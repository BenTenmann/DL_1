# Deep Learning Assignemnt 1
This is a repository for the first DL assignment for the *MPhil in Computational Biology*. For personal use (easier version control across platforms) and as a reference. See `dla1_641245` for detailed documentation.

This repo contains `Python` code for a perceptron and MLP from scratch and a CNN using the `Keras` API in `Python`.
